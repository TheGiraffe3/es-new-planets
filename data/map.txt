planet "Donya"
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/fields29
	description `Donya is a lush green world much like Earth, filled with vegetation. It even has clouds and a blue sky. However, it remains unsettled, because the clouds release sheets of poisonous acid on a regular timeframe. Between these moments of unrest the planet is completely peaceful. The trees and grasses planted by the first settlers seem to have adjusted to the terrible rain quite well.`

planet "Ealam"
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/clouds9
	description `As far as gas giants go, this one is somewhat sparse. Hardly any gas is contained in the interior, and it is mostly just empty space. A few white clouds are floating in the void, but in reality blue-tinted nothingness is the only object here.`

planet "New Gettysburg"
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/water22
	description `New Gettysburg is called as such because of the experiences of the first settlers. When New Gettysburg was initially being colonized, the explorers found wild beasts that looked like rocks. In attempting to scale cliffs in order to reach these rocks, many settlers were killed by small boulders tossed down on their heads. Eventually colonization attempts were given up, but New Gettysburg still bears the name the settlers gave it.`

planet "Zweig"
	attributes abandoned uninhabited
	landscape land/city26
	description `Zweig was inhabited until just a short while ago, when terrorists took over. When news of this reached other planets, the Navy sent a rescue fleet to save the inhabitants. The terrorists were arrested, and everybody on the planet left for a different, more peaceful, world. Nobody is left now, but the cities still stand.`
